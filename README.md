## Welcome to CustomNPCs Unofficial
CustomNPCs - modification For Minecraft games designed For creation own kart V RPG genre . A huge set of tools for creating your own NPCs and their abilities, custom blocks and items, quests and other game elements.

This is an unofficial repository of the Custom mod code . NPCs .

The code for version 1.20.1 is not available for the same reason.

Official **[website](https://www.kodevelopment.nl/minecraft/customnpcs)**.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">**Attention - this is important!**</span>
The modification provides extensive capabilities for writing scripts not only for the server-side but also for the client-side. Therefore:

For mod users:
* This could be exploited by malicious actors. Download maps or connect to servers you know you trust!

For server owners:
* The coder is given the ability to process packets, reflect, work with files, etc. Choose your programmers carefully.

## Differences from the original CustomNPCs mod by Noppes (or Goodbird):
Currently, everything written below applies to version **1.12.2**. Game version **1.20.1** currently only has a subset of these mechanics!
